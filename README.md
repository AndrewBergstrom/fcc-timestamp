# fcc-timestamp

## User Stories:
> 1. I can pass a string as a URL parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a Unix timestamp or a natural language date (ex. August 10, 2021 or Aug 10, 2021).

> 2. If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

> 3. If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns {"error": "Invalid Date"}.
